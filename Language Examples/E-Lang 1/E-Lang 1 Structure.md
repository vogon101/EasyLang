#E-Lang 1 Structure
E-Lang 1 is a very simple implementation of E-Lang which only supports a very simple, BASIC-like structure. Below is the structure required:
```
KEYWORD "String"
keyword variable
KeyWord 2 [Integer]
KEYWORD 2 "Hello World"
```

Keywords are defined by the user of E-Lang, they are defined as Parsers. Any keyword takes a set number of parameters.
